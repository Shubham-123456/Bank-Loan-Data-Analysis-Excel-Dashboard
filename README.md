# Bank-Loan-Data-Analysis-Excel-Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project analyzes bank loan applications data to uncover insights related to loan performance, customer demographics, and funding patterns.
The analysis is done in Microsoft Excel using advanced formulas, PivotTables, and interactive dashboards.
The project is designed to help stakeholders track loan portfolio performance, evaluate borrower behavior, and identify risk patterns.

## Objectives

1. To provide a comprehensive summary of loan applications.
2. To track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as loan amount, interest rates, and debt-to-income (DTI) ratios.
3. To analyze loan performance across multiple dimensions like loan term, purpose, grade, and borrower demographics.
4. To compare Good Loans vs Bad Loans for risk assessment.
5. To create interactive dashboards for decision-making.

## Data Analysis & KPIs

The following KPIs were created with Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-on-Month (MoM) calculations:

1. Total Loan Applications
2. Total Funded Amount
3. Total Amount Received
4. Average Interest Rate
5. Average DTI (Debt-to-Income) Ratio

## Visualizations

The dashboards include a variety of interactive charts and graphs:

✅ Good Loan vs Bad Loan Doughnut Chart
Good Loan: Fully Paid / Current
Bad Loan: Charged Off

✅ Loan Status Analysis (Bar Chart)
Metrics: Total Applications, Funded Amount, Received Amount, Avg. Interest Rate, Avg. DTI Ratio
Loan Status Categories: Fully Paid, Current, Charged Off

✅ Loan Applications by Month (Line Chart)
Trend analysis of loan applications over time

✅ Loan Applications by State (Map Chart)
Geographic distribution of loan applications across states

✅ Loan Applications by Loan Term (Bar Chart)
Comparison between 36-month (3 years) and 60-month (5 years) loans

✅ Loan Applications by Employee Length (Bar Chart)
Distribution from 1 year to 10+ years

✅ Loan Applications by Purpose (Bar Chart)
Business, debt consolidation, credit card, home improvement, etc.

✅ Loan Applications by Home Ownership (Bar Chart)
Own, Mortgage, Rent, Other

✅ Grade & Loan Purpose Slicers
Interactive filters for drilling down analysis

## Dashboards

The project includes two interactive dashboards:

Summary Dashboard – Quick snapshot of KPIs, Good vs Bad loans, and high-level insights.
Overview Dashboard – Detailed breakdown by loan status, month, geography, term, employee length, purpose, and ownership.

## Tools & Skills Used

Microsoft Excel
PivotTables & PivotCharts
Data Cleaning & Transformation
Conditional Formatting
Advanced Formulas (for KPI calculations)
Slicers & Interactive Dashboards

## Insights

Majority of loans are concentrated in a few states.
Higher loan applications are observed for Debt Consolidation and Credit Card purposes.
Borrowers with longer employee tenure (10+ years) tend to have higher loan approvals.
The interest rate and DTI ratio vary significantly by loan grade.
Bad loans are more likely in higher interest rate categories.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of bank loans and demonstrates how Excel can be leveraged for data analytics and dashboard reporting. It can serve as a template for financial institutions to monitor loan portfolios and identify risk patterns.
